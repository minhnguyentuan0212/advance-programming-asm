# Advanced Programming Concepts and Snake Game in C++

## Overview
This project explores advanced programming concepts across different paradigms, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) comparisons between Java and Ruby, functional programming comparisons between Haskell and SML, and introduces new programming approaches like Data Wrangling and Smart Contracts. Additionally, it includes a simple OOP-based Snake Game implemented in C++ using the SDL2 library.

## Key Concepts
- **OOP Comparison (Java vs Ruby):** Discusses class and object definitions, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Functional Programming (Haskell vs SML):** Covers pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, currying, function composition, and pattern matching.
- **New Programming Approaches:** Introduces Data Wrangling and Smart Contracts, highlighting their importance and application in current technology trends.
- **Snake Game:** A simple implementation of the classic Snake Game in C++, demonstrating practical OOP principles.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Java, Ruby, Haskell, SML, C++
- **Libraries:** SDL2 for the Snake Game
- **Tools:** MinGW for compiling the C++ game on Windows

## Running the Snake Game
### Prerequisites
- Ensure MinGW and SDL2 are installed on your system.
- The SDL2 library is required for running the game.

### Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the Snake Game directory.
3. Compile the game using MinGW with the command:
4. Run the compiled executable:


## Gameplay
Control the snake using the arrow keys to eat the red (1 point) and occasionally appearing yellow apples (5 points) while avoiding the walls and the snake's own tail. The game ends when all lives are lost.
